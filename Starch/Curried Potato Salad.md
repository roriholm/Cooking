- 2 lbs yellow flesh potatoes – e.g. Yukon gold
-   1 tbsp white vinegar
-   1 tbsp lemon juice – about 1/4 lemon's worth
-   1 tbsp yellow mustard – ballpark mustard aka American mustard
-   salt to season
-   3 eggs – large or extra large
-   1/2 red onion – diced
-   1 tbsp chives – minced
-   fried shallots to garnish – optional

-   Boil the potatoes in well salted water until a paring knife (a small sharp knife) slides in without resistance.
-   Drain and let cool until you are able to handle them. You want them still warm when you start this.
-   Peel the potatoes and cut them into 3/4 to 1 inch dice.
-   Spread the potatoes out on a cookie sheet that will fit in your refrigerator.
-   Combine 1 tbsp white vinegar with 1 tbsp yellow mustard.
-   Drizzle the potatoes with the vinegar mustard mixture. It doesn't have to be perfect. Just get some on every piece as best you can.
-   Season the potatoes with a liberal sprinkling of salt.
-   Place the potatoes (still on the cookie sheet) in the refrigerator for one hour.

-   Dice your red onion. Mince your chives.
    
-   In a bowl large enough to allow you to comfortably toss the ingredients add all the ingredients except the dressing.
    
-   Add half the dressing . Fold gently to start to combine. Add the rest of the dressing and fold until well mixed.
    
-   Refrigerate the dressed salad for one hour before serving.
    
-   Taste. The potato salad may need a bit more salt. I don't know how liberally you salted your potatoes. I don't know how much salt you put into the water to boil the potatoes. And I have no idea what your salt profile is. You will need to decide for yourself. It should be close though.
    
-   Garnish with a little bit of fried shallots if using. You don't want too much here. Just a hint of crunch and flavour. Too much can be overpowering.
