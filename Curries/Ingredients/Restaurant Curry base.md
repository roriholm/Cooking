-   2.5 lbs onions, quartered and broken up
-   6-8 cloves garlic peeled
-   1 1/2 Tbsp ginger coarsely chopped
-   1 1/2 Tbsp cumin powder
-   1 1/2 Tbsp coriander powder
-   1 1/2 tsp turmeric
-   1 1/2 tsp salt
-   12-15 fresh cilantro stalks with leaves – roots removed
-   1 cup vegetable oil
-   3 quarts water

Boil all then simmer, loosely covered for 1 hour,.

Add 15 oz can diced tomatoes. Simmer additional 20 minutes.
Let cool slightly, blend.

Simmer, loosely covered, until the oil separates out – this can take an hour or more. 
Stir the oil back into the base. At this point you can portion out the base into 2 cup portions and freeze if desired.
